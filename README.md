# Weather App

***This web app fetches and displays current-day weather (temperature, humidity, condition) using city-based queries. Integrated OpenWeatherMap API and handled edge-case errors such as invalid city inputs and API failure gracefully***

## Getting Started

1. Clone repo from Github:

    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/RohaidAhmed/weather-app.git
    ```

2. Go into directory:

    ```bash
    cd weather-app
    ```

3. Run the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deployment

This app is deployed on vercel. [`Demo`](orcast-weather.vercel.app)
